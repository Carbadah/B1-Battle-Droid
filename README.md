# B1 Battle Droid

A Star Wars themed Discord bot built with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).

If you want to self host, there are somethings you need to install
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and add it to PATH on Windows
* Create a config.json file. There is an example that you can download and edit included

Dependencies
* Discord.js
* Opusscript. **Please note:** The [get started page of the discord.js docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) suggests using node-opus instead of opusscript due to significant performance increase *but* I could not get node-opus to install so I use opusscript instead
